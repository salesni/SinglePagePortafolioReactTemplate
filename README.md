# React Portfolio Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Application Description

This application was developed for the Advance React Course of the FrontEnd Meta certification. Its purpose is to create a simple template for a Single Page Portfolio Application to demonstrate the concepts of *custom hooks*, *useRef*, *useEffect* and *useState hooks*, *context* and use of libraries. The GUI was created with the aid of the **Chakra UI Library** and the form validation with the aid of **Formik and Yup** libraries.
